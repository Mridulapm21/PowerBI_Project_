Anomaly detection in Power BI automatically detects anomalies in time series data. You can enable anomaly detection by: 
Selecting the chart
Selecting "Find anomalies" in the analytics pane
Changing the sensitivity according to your requirements
You can change the sensitivity to adjust how sensitive the algorithm is to changes in your data. Increasing the sensitivity will result in more anomaly data points. 
You can also change the anomaly color and shape. 

Anomaly is defined as “ an unexpected change within the data patterns, or an event that does not conform to the expected data pattern”. In short, Anomalies are abnormalities.
Anomaly detection aims at finding unexpected or rare events in time series data streams. One can find out significant deviations from the normal trend using Anomaly detection.
