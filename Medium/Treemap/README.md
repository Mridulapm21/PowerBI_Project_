A treemap in Power BI is a hierarchical chart that displays data as a set of nested rectangles. 
Each level of the hierarchy is represented by a colored rectangle called a branch node. 
Each branch contains smaller rectangles called leaf nodes.

Treemaps are used to: 
Display hierarchical data
Show the parent and child data distribution
Represent large amounts of hierarchically structured data.

In this project I have used treemap for showing the quater wise sales for each region.
