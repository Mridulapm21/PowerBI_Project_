 A waterfall chart in Power BI shows a running total as values are added and subtracted. 
 These charts are useful for understanding how an initial value is affected by a series of positive and negative changes.

 In my project you can see 4 colors
 Red represent negative
 Green represent positive 
 yellow represent others

 In my project obly 2 regions are able to see rest I have put in others option.
 So which is having hightest sales volume that 2 will be shown.
 Year wise sales volume will be seen.
 In a waterfall chart, each measure of change is a column on the chart
 A particular bar is positioned at the end of the previous bar and the baseline is based on whether there is an increase or decrease in the previous value.
 You can also change the Sentiment colors of the chart. You can click on the option and you will see different colors to depict Increase, Decrease, and Total. 
 You can change these colors as per your preference.
