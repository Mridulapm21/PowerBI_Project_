Here we've got a target for the number houses,no.of apartments/flats to increase normal sales to go up by 5 to 10% In line we have other measure and ie forecast 
we've got it so far upto 2016.
In the picture we can see a gray color this is the computer is expecting. 
That is the central forecast and the outer bound of the forecast 
And we have trend line too.We can see we start off relatively good all the time and them its gets seemingly getting worse.

For exxample suppose 
i am having a line chart I could have an upper bound of 40000 lower bound of 10000 and therefore I would have an error bar going all the way from 40000 to 10000 with 
the actual line chart going at 20000 Alternatively I can say its relative so the upper bound is 10000 lower bound is 20000
